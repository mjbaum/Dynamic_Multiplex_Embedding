# Dynamic Multiplex Embedding

In this work, we explore a spectral embedding method for dynamic graphs with multiple layers. The base model for this work is a network in which a set of shared nodes exhibit connections across a number of different layers and this multilayer network is observed at a fixed number of points in time. We extend the theory of Unfolded Adjacency Spectral Embedding (UASE) to the dynamic case and plan to provide stability guarantees as well as a central limit theorem.
